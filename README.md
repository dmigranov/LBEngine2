# NEEngine
A library for visualizing interactive and dynamic scenes in three-dimensional non-Euclidean spaces. Created using the Direct3D 11 API and the [DirectX Tool Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK).
Right now the library supports the visualization of the three-dimensional spherical, elliptic and toric spaces. You can also check out [the first version](https://github.com/dmigranov/SphEll3D) which is capable of visualizing scenes in three-dimensional spherical and elliptic spaces.
